303 - User test.
The goal of the project for me is to commit to a transaction. I failed to debug my shell script before deadline.

SIDAN - **build and deploy**
The initial goal for me was to be able to deploy SIDAN in docker image. This requires debuggin `nix-build`, which I am in the process of doing. However there is bigger picture. Understanding how to build `plutus-app` is an opportunity to learn how a complex project is automatically build, what are the challenges, what are design choices, etc.

aoc - **testing**; I started advent of code with Matthias, after completing the first task I decided to do some embelishments - I followed a [[TWEAG, testing in Haskell]] video to create an automated test with Hspec.

init: two projects as of now: SIDAN and 303-Unit Test.
