I implemented a test, a property test, and a suite using Tasty trees and QuickCheck properties.
[QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) is a combinator library for generating test cases in an approach called property testing (not to confuse with algorithms)

A [test suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_suite) is a collection of test cases that are intended to be used to test a software program.

A mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed is called an [oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_oracle)
Specified, Derived, Implicit, Human.
Test oracle problem.

303 - User test.
The goal of the project for me is to commit to a transaction. I failed to debug my shell script before deadline.

SIDAN - **build and deploy**
The initial goal for me was to be able to deploy SIDAN in docker image. This requires debuggin `nix-build`, which I am in the process of doing. However there is bigger picture. Understanding how to build `plutus-app` is an opportunity to learn how a complex project is automatically build, what are the challenges, what are design choices, etc.

aoc - **testing**; I started advent of code with Matthias, after completing the first task I decided to do some embelishments - I followed a [[TWEAG, testing in Haskell]] video to create an automated test with Hspec.

init: two projects as of now: SIDAN and 303-Unit Test.
