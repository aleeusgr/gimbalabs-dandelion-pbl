Cardano Community should have guidelines and best practices for testing dApps and products.

The guiding questions are:

At what stage of your project you introduce testing automation?
Unit testing, Integration Testing, API, UI, smart contract business logic testing, penetration testing. What is missing?
Developer performance, Smart Contract Optimization, Security. What are other goals of testing?
does your team use Quviq, plutip, tasty, Quickcheck?
What stack are you using? Do you use native testing tools in your stack?
When you create transactions, do you do it on Backend or FrontEnd?
How do you ensure correctness of Datum and Redeemer?
Do you perform input type validation and what tools are you using?
What black box testing tools and techniques do you use?
What testing tools or features could be added that could make your life easier as a developer
How are we testing the on-chain code?
How existing tools can be integrated with each other?
How do we facilitate development of the set of best practices for testing similar to Cardano Well-Architected Framework?

LFG!
